# Overture Custom Super Simple Intel 8085 Inspired CPU Architecture
_Overture_, from the French _ouverture_ meaning "opening," represents both a musical introduction that establishes themes to be developed later and a preliminary proposal or initiative.
This project aims to serve as an _introductory platform_ for electronics students who want a real introduction to VLSI design.

## üß† Overview
This is project primarily borrows from the Von-Neumann Architecture of CPU design and is more directly inspired by the Intel 8085.

**OVERTURE** is a custom-designed 8-bit microprocessor built for educational, experimental, and embedded applications. It is a modular CPU featuring a classic **fetch-decode-execute instruction cycle**, and supports multiple operational modes via a concise instruction format. Its design is loosely **inspired by the Intel 8085**, with modern simplifications and enhancements for clarity and experimentation.

## üîê Key Features

### 1. Clock Frequency

* Operates reliably up to **10 KHz**, ideal for FPGA demonstrations and logic simulation environments.

### 2. Instruction Modes

* Supports **four distinct operation modes** based on the first two bits of the 8-bit opcode:

  * `00` ‚Äì **Immediate Addressing Mode**
  * `01` ‚Äì **Calculation Mode**
  * `10` ‚Äì **Memory Copy Mode**
  * `11` ‚Äì **Conditional Checker Mode**

### 3. Supported Instructions

* Core logic and arithmetic operations:

  * **Logic**: `AND`, `OR`, `NAND`, `NOR`
  * **Arithmetic**: `8-bit ADD`, `8-bit SUB`

### 4. Instruction Format (8 bits)

* Opcode structure:

  ```
  [7:6] Mode Select (2 bits)
  [5:3] Source Register (3 bits)
  [2:0] Destination Register (3 bits)
  ```
* **Register Encoding** includes:

  * **Input**, **Output**
  * **Four Working Registers** (W0‚ÄìW3)
* Supports register-to-register and immediate-style operations depending on the mode.

### 5. Execution Model

* Fully synchronous operation based on the **Fetch ‚Üí Decode ‚Üí Execute** cycle:

  * **Fetch**: Program Counter retrieves instruction from memory.
  * **Decode**: Instruction is parsed by the control unit.
  * **Execute**: ALU and memory units perform actions according to control signals.

### 6. Memory Architecture

* **Program Counter**: 8-bit wide, allowing up to **256 instructions** to be addressed.
* **Address Bus**: 8-bit wide, enabling access to **256 memory locations**.
* **Data Bus**: 8-bit bi-directional, used for transferring instructions, operands, and results.

### 7. Modular Verilog Design

* Each functional block is encapsulated in its own Verilog module:

  * `ALU.v`: Arithmetic/logic operations
  * `DEC.v`: Instruction decoder
  * `COND.v`: Condition checking and flag evaluation
  * `RegisterPlus.v`: General-purpose and special-purpose registers
  * `OVERTURE.v`: Top-level integration and control logic

## üìò Notes

While inspired by legacy architectures like the Intel 8085, **OVERTURE** is an original CPU design that emphasizes clarity, simplicity, and modularity. Its instruction set and opcode format are streamlined for educational clarity and rapid prototyping rather than ISA compatibility with legacy microprocessors.
